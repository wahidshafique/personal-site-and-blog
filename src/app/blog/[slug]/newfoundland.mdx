## Pictures and thoughts

The first thing I remember was the muted awe of hearing this low, thundering note, consistently growing louder as we walked nearer to the start our trail. The picture above hardly outlines the magnitude of that feeling. It was taken during our hike down the [Cobbler's Path](https://www.eastcoasttrail.com/Modules/Facilities/Detail.aspx?id=506bc9c6-f470-496c-a24e-e0e378f5e6ad). I was reading Fahrenheit 451 during this trip, and found an apt description of this sense, in a round-about way, in one of the poems referenced in the story: [Dover Beach by Matthew Arnold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover_Beach). I particularly liked the characterization of that sound as "the eternal note of sadness", as it explains further,

> Sophocles long ago
> Heard it on the Ægæan, and it brought
> Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow
> Of human misery; we
> Find also in the sound a thought,
> Hearing it by this distant northern sea
