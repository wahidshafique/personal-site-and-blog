## Purpose

This is a work in progress and also a site that I want to use primarily as a blog and quick contact card. Eventually, I hope that much like how a [[PKM]] is meant to mold around what is optimal for the user, so to should this site mold into whatever peculiarities or design I want follow, for good and bad.

In particular I am trying to intuit this site without relying on too much secondary documentation or following the umpteenth "How to make a nextJs blog" article.

## Pillars

1. Be minimal and accessible. If the site is not possible to navigate, or if (in the future), any in-situ interactive elements are not usable by a screen reader. Then this is considered a failure.

2. Apply what I learn and accumulate to incrementally make the site better.

3. Transparent and open source, especially if the site is hitting any databases, there should not be any clandestine code.

4. Performant. The world already expends enough carbon serving up useless ads, so having a minimal footprint here is crucial.

## How it works

### Mdx

This is the driver of everything and I want to leverage the standard mdx syntax along with transformers that follow some [extended markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/) sugar, like footnotes etc.
